        <h1> W3 Server Software</h1> 
        <p>A <a href="#">W3</a> server, like the ftp <a href="#">daemon</a>
             , is a program which responds to an incoming tcp 
            connection and provides a service to the caller. There are many varieties 
            of W3 server software to serve different forms of data.

<div class="basic-daemon">
        <h1>The basic daemon</h1>
        <p> The basic W3 daemon program serves files already in hypertext or plain text. This daemon then is used as 
            a basis for many other types of server and gateway. Documentation includes:</p>

    <h1>Making a new server</h1>
    <p>This daemon is often used as a basis for a more specific server for a given application. 
        A server which allows a world of data to be seen as part of the W3 universe is known as a gateway. 
    (Most servers could therefore be regarded as gateways, but the term implies some conversion or mapping between dissimilar worlds) .

    <p>It is a good idea to pick the basic daemon or one of the servers below as a 
        starting point when making a new server.

                These are servers which provide data extracted from other systems. 
                they are built using code from the basic daemon, or scripts.
