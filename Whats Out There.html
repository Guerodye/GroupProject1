<h1> General Overview </h1>

<p>There is no "top" to the World-Wide Web. You can look at it from many points of view. If you have no other bias, here are some ways of looking for information.
</p>

<a href= "by Subjects" >by Subjects! </a>

<blockquote>
    <p>

        A classification by subject of interest. Incomplete but easiest to use.
    </p>
</blockquote>

<a href="by Type"> by Type!</a>

<blockquote>
    <p>
        Looking by type of service (access protocol, etc) may allow to find things if you know what you are looking for.

    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you have to use a "top" node, we recommend either this node or the subject list. See also: <a href="About the W3 project."> About the W3 project.!</a></p>
