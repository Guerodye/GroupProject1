<h1>What is HyperText</h1>
<p>Hypertext is text which is not constrained to be linear.</p>
<p>Hypertext is text which contains <a href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Terms.html#link">links</a> to other texts.
    The term was coined by <a href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Xanadu.html#Nelson">Ted Nelson</a> around 1965
    (see <a href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/History.html">History</a> ).</p>
<p>HyperMedia is a term used for hypertext which is not constrained to be text: it can include graphics,
    video and <a href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Talks/YesWeCan.snd">sound</a> , for example. Apparently Ted Nelson was the first to use this term too.</P>
<p>Hypertext and HyperMedia are concepts, not products.<?P>
