<h1>How can I help?</h1>
There are lots of ways you can help if you are interested in seeing the web grow and be even more useful...
<li> <a href=".html">Put up some data</a></li>
There are many ways of doing this. The web needs both raw data -- fresh hypertext or old plain text files, or smart servers giving views of existing databases. See <a href="">more details</a> , <a href="">etiquette</a>.
<li>Suggest someone else does</li>
Maybe you know a system which it would be neat to have on the web. How about suggesting to the person involved that they put up a W3 server?
<li>Manage a subject area</li>
If you know something of what's going on in a particular field, organization or country, would you like to keep up-to-date an overview of online data?
<li><a href="">Write some software</a></li>
We have a big list of things to be done. Help yourself -- all contributions gatefully received! see the list .
<li>Send us suggestions</li>
We love to get mail... www-bug@info.cern.ch
<li>Tell your friends</li>
Install/get installed the client software on your site. Quote things by their W3 address to allow w3 users to pick them straight up.
